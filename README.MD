# Pathfinding Algorithms Animator
This project aims to create an animator that shows the behaviour of many pathfinding algorithms.

The project is written with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Golang.
<div float="left">
    <img src="readme_files/html.svg" width=40>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <img src="readme_files/css.svg" width=40>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <img src="readme_files/javascript.svg" width=40>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <img src="readme_files/go.svg" width=40>
</div>

Golang is being used to execute the algorithms in the server side, so javascript will not be responsible for the expensive work.
